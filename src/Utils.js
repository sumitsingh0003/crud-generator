        dataContent:`API (Application Programming Interface) is a computing interface that defines how software components interact with each other. It is a way of programmatically interacting with a separate software component or resource and expose functionality for internal or external use and testing. API defines what <h2>requests can </h2> be made, how they will be made and hides complexity from developers. API extends systems to partners, organizes code, and makes components reusable.`
